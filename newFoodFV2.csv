To make the dressing, grate the zest from 1 lemon.

Add the egg yolk, a pinch of salt and a squeeze of lemon juice and stir thoroughly to combine. Continuing to stir, pour in 1/2 cup of the oil, drop by drop. The mixture should look smooth and creamy, a sign that you are building a stable emulsion. Continuing to stir, begin adding the oil in a slow stream. The dressing should thicken. Periodically stop pouring in the oil and add a squeeze of lemon. Taste the dressing and add more salt and lemon juice to taste.
Add water, a small spoonful at a time, stirring to thin dressing to the consistency of heavy cream. This makes about 2 cups dressing. You may not use all the dressing for the salad; the remainder will keep, covered and refrigerated, for up to 2 days.Croutons3 slices day-old bread, each 1 inch thick, torn into 1 1/2-inch chunks2 tablespoons olive oil

Let it sit, stirring occasionally, while you prepare the sauce for the fish.
MAKE THE CILANTRO TAMARIND PASTE:
Put the cilantro, garlic, tamarind, 2 tablespoons plus one teaspoon of soy sauce, the onion, shallots, anchovies or anchovy paste, and the juice of half of one lime into your food processor. Pull the tamarind apart into small pieces before putting into the food processor, to make sure there are no hard seeds in it. If you want heat, add a fresh chili that has been coarsely chopped.
Process for about ten seconds, scrape down, process again, scrape down and, if necessary, process a third time. You want the pieces to be small and the mixture well combined, but you do not want a liquidy puree.
Heat the vegetable oil in a small, heavy saucepan with a lid. Before it starts to smoke, add the onion, cilantro and tamarind mixture and stir well. Simmer for about ten minutes, stirring occasionally.
Put the lid on and set aside. It will hold, unrefrigerated, for a few hours.
PREPARE THE FISH: Fire up your grill to medium heat or preheat your oven on the broiler setting. If broiling, put some foil down on the pan. Pat dry the swordfish steaks and sprinkle well with salt. Rub in the olive oil. Juice another half lime and set aside.
FINISH MAKING THE GLAZE: Press the tamarind pulp through a fine strainer.
Add the juice of half a lime and a teaspoon of soy sauce. Juice the other half lime and set aside.
TOAST THE PUMPKIN SEEDS, IF USING: Preheat the oven to about 375 degrees Fahrenheit. Toast the pumpkin seeds on a baking sheet lined with parchment, on the top shelf of your oven, turning once, for about five minutes, or until lightly browned.
Remove from the oven and toss in a bowl with 1 teaspoon of soy sauce or more to taste. Put back in the oven on the parchment-lined pan for 2 - 3 minutes.
Remove and set aside.
COOK THE FISH: When the grill or broiler is hot - you want your coals to be white -- cook the fish on one side for 3 -5 minutes minutes, depending on the thickness of the steaks and on how well you like your swordfish cooked.
While the fish is grilling, bring the sauce to a good simmer over medium heat.
Add the rice wine and cook for a minute or two. (When I broil, I don't pierce the foil, so that I can collect the juices, which I then strain and add to the sauce at this point.) Taste the sauce and add more lime juice -- or a pinch of sugar if it's too tart -- and salt, to taste.
Flip the fish over and baste with the tamarind glaze. Cook the second side, then flip once more and baste again, cooking only for about ten or fifteen seconds.
Serve with the sauce.
Garnish with the tamari roasted pumpkin seeds, if using.

Core tomatoes. Bring a large pot of water to a rolling boil.

Remove tomatoes carefully from hot water onto cutting board. Allow to cool slightly, then peel tomatoes using a fork. Discard skins.In a large saucepan, warm olive oil over low heat.

Add tomatoes, crushing them with a potato masher until they are broken down and juicy.

Heat a gas grill to medium high or prepare a medium hot charcoal fire.
Cut the salmon crosswise into 1-inch-wide strips, 3to 4 oz. each. Thread the skewers through the salmon strips: starting at the tapered end, carefully pierce the flesh, pushing the skewer all the way through to the fat end until the point pokes through. When the grill is just on the hot side of medium (you should be able to hold your hand just above the grate for 2seconds), use tongs to clean the grate with a lightly oiled paper towel. Season the salmon lightly with salt and brush lightly with olive oil.
Put the brochettes on the grill, skin side down, keeping the exposed skewer ends away from the fire if using bamboo. The salmon will cook quickly but not always at the same rate. Cook until the skin is crisp and it releases from the grill, 2 to 3 minutes. Turn the brochettes with tongs or a spatula and cook another 1 minute. If necessary, turn again and cook another 1 minute.

Other garnish options: Omit the Parmesan, and sauce with strong Dijon mustard, either plain or thinned with crme frache. A little finely diced shallot, macerated briefly in lemon juice or vinegar, adds a nice spark and refreshing crunch.

Fold it in half so its double thickness, then fold it in half again. You should end up with what looks like a big, foil birthday card. Make two of these then lay them opened and flat on your table. Each foil wrap will hold one piece of fish you can do a big one for four or a slightly smaller version for two.In a pestle and mortar, bash your lime leaves until they break down and all the flavour comes out. Then add the lemon grass and do the same again. Do this for a couple of minutes... its worth every second. Then add the garlic, chilli, grated ginger and all of the coriander stalks. Once this is all smashed to a pulp, add the soy sauce, the lime zest and juice and the olive old.
Mix well, then taste and correct the seasoning with extra soy sauce as you see fit.Lightly score the sea bass on the skin side with a sharp knife and then rub them with the lime-ginger-lemon grass mix. Allow to marinate for an hour, if you have time, or you can cook it all straight away.Lightly brush the foil edges with a little beaten egg white this helps to seal the parcel when you fold it up and keeps all the flavoured steam inside to cook the fish.
Put the portions of sea bass, skin-side up on one side of each envelope. Divide the marinade and all the juice between the two packages and tuck some coriander into the slits of each piece of fish. Fold over the foil, then fold up two sides of the envelopes securely. Just before you seal the final side of the foil bags, divide the sake between the two envelopes, taking care so that it doesnt dribble out. Pucker and bend the folded sides up so that the juices cant cook out. Dont fold the foil right up to the edge of the fish leave about 2 inches (5 cm) of space all round the fillets to let the steam circulate.I know all this sounds like a bit of a palaver, but its actually dead simple.
Place straight on to the hot tray and cook for about 12 minutes in the preheated oven. Once cooked, allow to sit for 23 minutes.
Serve the bags at the table just cut them open and carefully lift out the fish. You can spoon the juices over it (but dont eat the bits from the marinade as theyre really only there for flavour).I like to serve this with a bowl of coriander-flavoured rice or noodles, cooked simply. Youre going to love it.Tip","1) Preheat your oven to 220C/425F/gas Take the top shelf out of the oven and place a baking tray on the middle shelf.
2) Tear off a metre of kitchen foil.
3) Fold it in half so its double thickness, then fold it in half again.
4) You should end up with what looks like a big, foil birthday card.
5) Make two of these then lay them opened and flat on your table.
6) Each foil wrap will hold one piece of fish you can do a big one for four or a slightly smaller version for two.
7) In a pestle and mortar, bash your lime leaves until they break down and all the flavour comes out.
8) Then add the lemon grass and do the same again.
9) Do this for a couple of minutes... its worth every second.
10) Then add the garlic, chilli, grated ginger and all of the coriander stalks.
11) Once this is all smashed to a pulp, add the soy sauce, the lime zest and juice and the olive old.
12) Mix well, then taste and correct the seasoning with extra soy sauce as you see fit.
13) Lightly score the sea bass on the skin side with a sharp knife and then rub them with the lime-ginger-lemon grass mix.
14) Allow to marinate for an hour, if you have time, or you can cook it all straight away.
15) Lightly brush the foil edges with a little beaten egg white this helps to seal the parcel when you fold it up and keeps all the flavoured steam inside to cook the fish.
16) Put the portions of sea bass, skin-side up on one side of each envelope.
17) Divide the marinade and all the juice between the two packages and tuck some coriander into the slits of each piece of fish.
18) Fold over the foil, then fold up two sides of the envelopes securely.
19) Just before you seal the final side of the foil bags, divide the sake between the two envelopes, taking care so that it doesnt dribble out.
20) Pucker and bend the folded sides up so that the juices cant cook out.
21) Dont fold the foil right up to the edge of the fish leave about 2 inches (5 cm) of space all round the fillets to let the steam circulate.
22) I know all this sounds like a bit of a palaver, but its actually dead simple.
23) Place straight on to the hot tray and cook for about 12 minutes in the preheated oven.
24) Once cooked, allow to sit for 23 minutes.
25) Serve the bags at the table just cut them open and carefully lift out the fish.
26) You can spoon the juices over it (but dont eat the bits from the marinade as theyre really only there for flavour).I like to serve this with a bowl of coriander-flavoured rice or noodles, cooked simply.

When the oil is warm, add the sliced onion and fennel to the pot, and season with salt and pepper. Allow the vegetables to sweat for 2 minutes, and then add in the sliced garlic. Cook the vegetables for another 3 minutes.
Next, add in the can of drained petite diced tomatoes and the white wine. Raise the heat to high, and allow the wine to reduce slightly for about 2 minutes.
Add the fish stock to the pot, and add in the saffron and the bay leaf. When the stock comes to a boil, reduce the heat to low, and allow the stock to simmer uncovered for 10 minutes. It is this part of the process from which ""bouillabaisse"" gets its name: the first part of the word means ""to boil,"" and the second, ""to lower."" The saffron will bloom in the simmering liquid, and will steep like tea in the stock, causing it to turn its trademark marigold color. Season again lightly with salt and pepper.
After 10 minutes have passed, add in the rock shrimp and the mussels, and stir them around in the bouillabaisse broth. They should take no more than 3 minutes to cook; the shrimp will turn from grey to coral in color, and the mussels will open.
While the stock is simmering, cook the sea bass. Begin by seasoning the sea bass well with salt and pepper on both sides. Then cover the bottom of a large nonstick sauté pan with olive oil—a typical pan will require about 2 tablespoons.
Heat the oil on medium-high heat, and when the oil starts to shimmer, add the four filets of fish. Cook for about 3-4 minutes per side, until golden.

Combine the black and white sesame seeds on a plate. Dip each fish fillet first in the egg-white mixture to coat both sides, then in the sesame seeds to cover completely, shaking off any excess.
Place each fillet as it is coated on a baking sheet.
Preheat the oven to its lowest setting.
Heat the remaining cup oil in a large, heavy skillet over medium-high heat.
Add half the fish fillets or as many as will fit comfortably; do not crowd the pan. Saut until lightly browned on both sides, about 3 minutes per side, depending on the thickness of the fillets. Adjust the heat as necessary so the fillets brown nicely but the seeds dont burn. Using a slotted spatula, transfer the fillets to paper towels to drain, then to a platter. Cover loosely with aluminum foil and keep warm in the oven while you saut the remaining fillets.

Im not too crazy about dill, but do like how it combines with fish, so used a moderate amount.Action shot! I love how this one came out.

Heat two tbsp butter and sautee the onion and carrot over medium heat. Keep stirring every now and then, nothing should end up browned.Thawed 4 pieces of whitefish fillet.

Just get it all in there, lower the heat and let it cook until it starts to fall apart. Flip it over every now and then.Pretty soon the fish is going to fall apart and flake. Break up the coarse pieces.Top the fish with 1 heaping tbsp flour, stir a bit and cook for one minute. Slowly pour in the milk while carefully stirring until you have a sauce consistency you like. It shouldnt be too thin, though.
Add a good pinch of salt and pepper. I used my fingers and kept checking the seasoning, so cant give you exact quantities. It just varies every time I make this dish.Ive added 1/2 tsp Dijon mustard, its pretty heavy in flavor but goes really well with the fish. Use less if you like. Also threw in a heaping tbsp sour cream, and for lack of fresh lemon juice, I committed sacrilege and used one of those plastic jars and just squeezed a little in. Dont tell anyone!In goes the dill. Now simmer the sauce over low heat for another minute or two.
Transfer it all to a baking dish.

Pop in a preheated oven for 10 to 15 minutes, until the top is golden brown and crispy.
Serve with french fries and a nice mixed vegetable salad on the side. My boy doesnt even need utensils with this, he simply uses the fish as a dip for his French fries. No, I didnt raise him like that, but what can you do? :)Printable

The Directions.Use a 4-6 quart slow cooker.
Spread a length of foil onto the countertop, and put the salmon fillets directly in the middle.In a small bowl, melt the butter in the microwave, then stir in lime juice, pepper, garlic, and parsley.
Brush this mixture all over the top of your fish. Fold the foil over and crimp the sides to make a packet.Put this packet into the bottom of an empty slow cooker. Cover, and set to high for two hours.Your fish is finished when it flakes easily with a fork.
Serve with steamed broccoli and quinoa (or something similar).on a fish plate.The Verdict.The salmon gets infused with a nice mild citrusy flavor---it's not too limey, and if I didn't know better, I'd probably think it's lemon. And yup, if you'd rather use up the lemons on your tree, go ahead and use them! It's all good.This was enough fish for me and Adam and the girls, but would really only fill up two adults.

Add the scallions, ginger, and garlic, and stir until the garlic gives off its aroma, about 30 seconds.
Remove from the heat, add the sugar snap peas, and stir just until they are coated with the oil. Season the vegetables lightly with salt and pepper (the soy sauce and ginger will provide salt and heat).
Lightly season the cod with salt and pepper. Open a foil square and place a fillet on the bottom half. Top with one-fourth of the vegetables, 1 tablespoon soy sauce, and 1 tablespoon butter, cut into a few pieces. Sprinkle with one fourth of the chopped cashews. Fold the square over to enclose the fish and vegetables, and tightly crimp the edges closed.
Place on a large baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining fish, vegetables, soy sauce, and butter.
Bake for 15 minutes.
Remove from the oven and let stand for 5 minutes (this will complete the cooking of the fish).
To serve, place a foil packet on each dinner plate. Allow everyone to open each foil package by piercing it with the tip of a sharp dinner knife. You can spill the contents of the package onto each plate or eat directly out of the foil. Take care: The escaping steam can be very hot!

7) Remove from the heat, add the sugar snap peas, and stir just until they are coated with the oil.
8) Season the vegetables lightly with salt and pepper (the soy sauce and ginger will provide salt and heat).
9) Lightly season the cod with salt and pepper.

16) Bake for 15 minutes.
17) Remove from the oven and let stand for 5 minutes (this will complete the cooking of the fish).
18) To serve, place a foil packet on each dinner plate.
19) Allow everyone to open each foil package by piercing it with the tip of a sharp dinner knife.
20) You can spill the contents of the package onto each plate or eat directly out of the foil.
